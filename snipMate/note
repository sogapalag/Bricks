cpp alias c.

need comment alias, if you don't want c.snippets while write cpp


in file
~/.vim_runtime/sources_non_forked/vim-snippets/snippets/cpp.snippets

although extends C, but comment which not work. since first file alias.
so I don't know the 'extends C' do any thing?
anyway delete it.


now we can write own cpp.snippets.
